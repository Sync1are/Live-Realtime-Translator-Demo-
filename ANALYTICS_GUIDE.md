## Data Sources

The analytics derive data from:

1. **Timer Sessions** (`timer-sessions.json`)
   - Focus session duration and timing
   - Break session duration and timing
   - Pomodoro vs. manual sessions

2. **Task History** (`task-history.json`)
   - Completed tasks with timestamps
   - Task categories and metadata
   - Task completion dates

3. **Task Scheduler**
   - Current pending tasks
   - In-progress tasks
   - Task status changes

## Generating Test Data

To see the dashboards in action with sample data:

1. Open the Analytics Dashboards page
2. Click the **"ðŸ“Š Generate Test Data"** button
3. Confirm the action
4. The system will create:
   - 3-6 focus sessions per day for the past 7 days
   - 1-3 break sessions per day
   - 2-5 completed tasks per day with various categories
5. Dashboards will automatically refresh with the new data

## Customizing Goals

Default daily goals:
- Focus Time: 240 minutes (4 hours)
- Tasks: 5 per day

To modify goals, use the API:
```javascript
await window.notificationAPI.analyticsSetDailyGoals({
  focusTimeMinutes: 300,  // 5 hours
  tasksCount: 8           // 8 tasks
});
```

## Responsive Design

The dashboards are fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full layout with side-by-side charts
- **Tablet**: Stacked charts, optimized for portrait orientation
- **Minimum Width**: 768px (tablet width)

## Technology Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework
- **Recharts**: React-based charting library
- **React 18**: Required for Recharts components
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No build system required

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Record Sessions Regularly**: Start focus and break sessions to accumulate data
2. **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed to see accurate statistics
3. **Use Categories**: Assign categories to tasks for better insights in the weekly chart
4. **Review Weekly**: Check the weekly dashboard to identify trends and patterns
5. **Set Realistic Goals**: Adjust daily goals based on your actual capacity

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

- Ensure you have completed tasks or focus sessions
- Use the "Generate Test Data" button to populate sample data
- Check that the date range is correct

### Charts Not Rendering

- Ensure you have an internet connection (for CDN resources)
- Check the browser console for errors
- Verify Recharts and React libraries are loading

### Date Navigation Issues

- Click the date picker to manually select a date
- Use the arrow buttons for relative navigation
- Current day is set automatically on load
