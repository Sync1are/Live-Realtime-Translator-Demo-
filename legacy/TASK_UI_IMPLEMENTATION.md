# Task UI & Timer Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive task management UI with integrated timer functionality and time-blocking features for the Electron notification engine application.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Service: TaskService.js

**Location:** `electron/services/TaskService.js`

**Responsibilities:**
- Full CRUD operations for tasks
- Timer management (start, pause, resume)
- Time tracking with accumulated sessions
- Time log storage
- Task status management
- Category and tag management
- Rollover task tracking

**Key Methods:**
- `createTask(taskData)` - Create a new task
- `updateTask(taskId, updates)` - Update existing task
- `deleteTask(taskId)` - Delete a task
- `startTimer(taskId)` - Start timing a task
- `pauseTimer()` - Pause the active timer
- `resumeTimer(taskId)` - Resume a paused task
- `completeTask(taskId)` - Mark task as completed
- `getActiveTask()` - Get currently active task with timer info
- `getTasksFiltered(filters)` - Get filtered task list
- `markRollovers()` - Mark incomplete tasks as rollovers

**Data Model:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  estimatedMinutes: number,
  actualMinutes: number,
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',
  categories: string[],
  tags: string[],
  status: 'not_started' | 'in_progress' | 'paused' | 'completed',
  createdDate: ISO string,
  startedDate: ISO string | null,
  completedDate: ISO string | null,
  isPendingFromYesterday: boolean,
  scheduledDate: ISO date string | null,
  scheduledTimeBlock: { start: string, end: string } | null
}
```

**Time Log Model:**
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  startTime: ISO string,
  endTime: ISO string,
  durationMinutes: number
}
```

### 2. Frontend UI: tasks.html

**Location:** `electron/tasks.html`

**Features:**
- Clean, modern task management interface
- Dual view: Task Lists and Time Blocking
- Quick-add input with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd+N)
- Task creation/editing modal
- Floating active task timer indicator
- Filtering by priority, category, and rollover status
- Responsive design

**UI Sections:**
1. **Header**: Navigation and new task button
2. **Quick Add**: Fast task creation
3. **View Switcher**: Toggle between Lists and Time Blocking
4. **Filters**: Priority, category, and rollover filters
5. **Task Lists**: Four columns for each status
6. **Time Blocking**: Daily schedule with time slots
7. **Floating Timer**: Bottom-right corner active task indicator
8. **Task Modal**: Create/edit form

### 3. Frontend Logic: tasks.js

**Location:** `electron/tasks.js`

**Key Functions:**
- Task rendering and list management
- Timer updates and formatting
- Modal management
- Tag/category input handling
- Filter application
- Event listeners for task events
- Time-blocking view rendering

### 4. IPC Integration

**Main Process (main.js):**
- Added TaskService initialization
- Registered IPC handlers for all task operations
- Setup event listeners for task events
- Integration with analytics and daily stats

**Preload (preload.js):**
- Exposed task API methods via `window.notificationAPI`
- Task event listeners for real-time updates

**IPC Handlers:**
```
task-create
task-update
task-delete
task-get-all
task-get-by-id
task-get-by-status
task-get-filtered
task-start-timer
task-pause-timer
task-resume-timer
task-complete
task-get-active
task-get-time-logs
task-get-all-categories
task-get-all-tags
task-mark-rollovers
```

**IPC Events:**
```
task-completed
task-timer-started
task-timer-paused
task-timer-resumed
```

## Data Flow

### Creating a Task
1. User fills out form in tasks.html
2. `saveTask()` called in tasks.js
3. `window.notificationAPI.taskCreate()` invokes IPC
4. Main process handles `task-create`
5. TaskService.createTask() creates task
6. Task saved to tasks.json
7. Response returned to renderer
8. UI updates with new task

### Starting a Timer
1. User clicks "Start" button
2. `startTask(taskId)` called in tasks.js
3. `window.notificationAPI.taskStartTimer()` invokes IPC
4. Main process handles `task-start-timer`
5. TaskService.startTimer() updates task status
6. TimerService.startFocusSession() called
7. `task-timer-started` event emitted
8. Floating timer appears and updates

### Pausing/Resuming
1. User clicks "Pause" or "Resume"
2. Corresponding function called in tasks.js
3. IPC invoked to main process
4. TaskService calculates elapsed time
5. Time log entry created and saved
6. Task status updated
7. Event emitted to renderer
8. UI reflects new state

### Completing a Task
1. User clicks "Complete" button
2. `completeTask(taskId)` called
3. IPC invoked to main process
4. TaskService pauses timer if active
5. Task status set to 'completed'
6. Analytics service notified
7. Daily stats updated
8. UI moves task to completed list

## Technical Details

### Data Storage
- **Tasks**: `{userData}/tasks.json`
- **Time Logs**: `{userData}/task-time-logs.json`
- File-based JSON storage for portability
- Automatic save on every change

### Timer Implementation
- Client-side: 1-second interval update loop
- Server-side: Precise time tracking with Date.now()
- Accumulated time stored in `actualMinutes`
- Current session calculated on-the-fly in `getActiveTask()`
- Time logs store individual work sessions

### Event-Driven Architecture
- TaskService emits events for state changes
- Main process forwards events to renderer
- Renderer listens and updates UI reactively
- Enables real-time synchronization

### Integration Points
1. **AnalyticsService**: Records completed tasks
2. **EndOfDayService**: Updates daily task count
3. **TimerService**: Manages focus sessions
4. **GamificationService**: (via events) Task completion triggers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Task**
   - Test all field combinations
   - Validate required fields
   - Test categories/tags input

2. **Timer Operations**
   - Start timer on new task
   - Pause and verify time logged
   - Resume and verify continuation
   - Complete while timer running

3. **Multiple Tasks**
   - Start task A
   - Start task B (should auto-pause A)
   - Resume task A

4. **Time Blocking**
   - Schedule tasks for different time slots
   - Verify display in time-blocking view
   - Start from time block

5. **Filters**
   - Filter by each priority level
   - Filter by category
   - Filter rollovers
   - Clear filters

6. **Persistence**
   - Create tasks, restart app
   - Verify tasks persist
   - Verify time logs persist

7. **Edge Cases**
   - Delete active task (should fail)
   - Long-running tasks (> 24 hours)
   - Zero-estimate tasks
   - Tasks without categories/tags

## Known Limitations

1. **Single Active Task**: Only one task can have an active timer at a time
2. **No Subtasks**: Tasks are flat, no hierarchy
3. **Fixed Time Blocks**: Hourly blocks only (9-10, 10-11, etc.)
4. **No Recurring Tasks**: Each task is unique
5. **Local Storage**: Data not synced across devices

## Future Enhancements

1. **Recurring Tasks**: Daily, weekly, monthly patterns
2. **Subtasks**: Break tasks into smaller pieces
3. **Task Dependencies**: Task A must complete before B
4. **Custom Time Blocks**: 30-minute or custom durations
5. **Task Templates**: Pre-configured task patterns
6. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and batch actions
7. **Export/Import**: CSV, JSON, iCal formats
8. **Calendar Integration**: Sync with Google Calendar, Outlook
9. **Collaboration**: Share tasks with team members
10. **Mobile App**: iOS/Android companion app
