The timer updates every second and shows time in HH:MM:SS format.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd+N**: Focus the quick-add input
- **Escape**: Close any open modal

## Data Storage

All task data is stored locally in:
- `tasks.json`: Task information
- `task-time-logs.json`: Time tracking logs

These files are in your Electron app's userData directory.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Set Realistic Estimates**: Track your actual time to improve future estimates
2. **Use Categories**: Organize tasks by project or area (Work, Personal, etc.)
3. **Prioritize Wisely**: Use "Urgent" sparingly for truly critical tasks
4. **Review Rollovers**: Check "Pending from Yesterday" tasks each morning
5. **Time Block Your Day**: Plan your day in advance using the time-blocking view
6. **Monitor Time Comparison**: Use over/under indicators to improve time estimation
7. **Pause When Interrupted**: Pause timers during breaks to maintain accurate logs
8. **Complete Tasks Promptly**: Move completed tasks to the Completed list to keep organized

## Integration with Other Features

- **Analytics**: Completed tasks feed into the analytics dashboard
- **Daily Stats**: Task completion updates daily statistics
- **Gamification**: Earn XP and achievements for completing tasks
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications for scheduled tasks (via main app)

## Troubleshooting

**Timer not updating:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if another task has an active timer

**Task won't delete:**
- Make sure the task doesn't have an active timer
- Pause or complete the task first

**Categories not showing in filter:**
- Create tasks with categories first
- The filter populates from existing categories

**Time-blocking view is empty:**
- Make sure tasks have both a scheduled date and time block assigned
- Check that you're viewing today's date

  priority: 'high'
});
```
